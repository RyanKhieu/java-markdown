##### The names of [[variables]] in the Java language are referred to as **identifiers**.

# Choosing a variable name:
The best naming convention is to choose a variable name that will tell the reader of the program what the variable represents. Variables names that describe the data stored at that particular memory location are called **mnemonic variables**. For example, if you wish to store a grade on a test, a variable name such as grade would be more easily remembered than a variable name such as var2.

# Rules for naming variables:
- All variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet, an underscore, or ( _ ), or a dollar sign ($). The convention is to always use a letter of the alphabet. The dollar sign and the underscore are discouraged as the first character.
- After the first initial letter, variable names may also contain letters and the digits 0 to 9. No spaces or special characters are allowed.
- The name can be of any length, but don't get carried away. Remember that you will have to type this name.
- Uppercase characters are distinct from lowercase characters. Using ALL uppercase letters are primarily used to identify constant variables. Remember that variable names are case-sensitive.
- You cannot use a Java keyword (reserved word) for a variable name.

> [!TIP]
> Some programmers use underscore in variable names to separate parts of the name, such as **shipping_weight**. Others prefer a "capital style" notation, such as **shippingWeight** to separate parts of the name. NEVER use uppercase for every letter in a variable name, because uppercase names are reserved for final (constant) variables.
